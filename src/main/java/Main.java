    //player can be either of value 1 or 2. For the value 1, a red square is being placed, For the value 2, a yellow square

    //This method gets 2 arguments
    //x is the x position of the asked square
    //y is the y position of the asked square
    //The method returns an int value: if the value is 0 - the square is empty, if the value is 1 - the square is occupied by
